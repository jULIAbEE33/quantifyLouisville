# quantifyLouisville
QuantifyLouisville is a podcast created by Eric Bickel and Michael Weis. This website is a landing page describing the podcast and creators. All of the links should fully function. However, the newletter page does not, since the backend hasn't been built to store email's in a database yet. Nothing special is required to view the website, just clone the repo and open index.html on your browser of choice.
The website is responsive and should be easily viewed across all browsers. Media queries have been added to also make it mobile friendly. The JavaScript file runs on the "Newsletter" page and was used to create a countdown clock.
